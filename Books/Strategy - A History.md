### Chapter 18 - Marx and a Strategy for the Working Class

* Focus of this new section is on strategy from the perspective of the "underdog", or those who face a large gap between their desired ends and their available means, and how strategies are used to influence the minds of a large population.
* Theories will span from how organizations sought to overturn the existing power structure, ranging from fringe radicals to eventually cumulating in the professional field of modern day politics and presidential campaigns.
* The rise of social sciences became a driving force in the development and evolution of these theories.

#### The Professional Revolutionaries

* Strategies to upend the existing social order can trace their inspirations to the French Revolution of 1789. Beginning with the proof of the overthrow of the monarchy and spread of enlightenment ideals, economic downturn in the 1840s set the stage for "professional revolutionaries " to begin to take action and devise plans to overturn the existing social order. 
* Diverse political opinions flourished, but were stifled by a lack of concrete strategies to implement the world that revolutionaries preached, including convincing a large population as to why and how they should overthrow the existing power structure.
* Karl Marx's writings on historical materialism provided the foundation to many 20th century revolutionaries' strategies, while simultaneously acting as a source of division due to different interpretations of his writings.  

#### 1848

* Marx's strategy was grounded in revolution through class struggle. Through his writings (i.e. The Communist Manifesto, 1848), Marx dismissed all competing revolutionary appeals at the time. Rather than religion, culture, human rights, or patriotism, Marx proposed the driving force behind societal change is found in economic and social conditions.
* 1848 marked a year of revolutions across Europe, including France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and the Austrian Empire. While making strides in democratic progress, fatigue, along with an improving economy across Europe, prevented the revolutions across Europe from being the Proletarian freeing revolutions that Marx envisioned.
* Marx's theory of revolution ran into the following problems:
	* A lack of Proletarian "class consciousness". The idea that the populous is united and aware of the economic struggle between them and the ruling class.
	* Raising class consciousness required undermining other valid reasons for revolution, such as patriotism, religion, and enlightenment ideals.
	* A lack of unity between class groups. The urban working class, peasant / farm-working class, and merchant / artisan class (petit-bourgeois) did not see each other as sharing the same overall class struggle. Each group had their own grievances and tolerances to radical change.
	* A lack of support by the working class to support interclass change among the bourgeoise. Marx proposed that the working class would need to support the middle class (petit-bourgeois) in their revolt against the Bourgeoise in order to secure better conditions for a continued Proletarian revolution. Lack of working class support stemmed from an unwillingness to  commit to violent change for a society that would still exploit the working class in the near future.


#### The Strategy of Insurrection
* After the failures of the 1848 revolutions across Europe, Marx and Engels proposed that uprisings would not succeed so long as a state's army remains loyal.
* In turn, revolutionaries would need to raise an army of their own, one large enough to not only defeat a nation's army, but any outside nation's army that is counter-revolutionary.
* Engels reflects on the armed uprisings in Germany in 1849, and how the German National Assembly had not organized and supported the armed insurrections. 
* Since the revolutionary armed force is at an overwhelming disadvantage against the state's military, Engels proposes that armed insurrections should be timed with the point of most support by the masses, act fast without hesitation, stay on the offensive, and not let up to even have a chance at success. Even then this would not be sufficient unless all counter-revolutionary forces are completely defeated, including those of outside countries who may interfere.
* Given the sheer scale of unpredictability of armed insurrection, the question remains how to strike a balance between being patient in the face of injustice, and acting out when the cause is hopeless.



### Chapter 19 - Herzen and Bakunin

* Alexander Herzen was a 19th Century writer who expressed both an enthusiasm for radical change, while also aware of the realities of a violent revolution and often favoured a peaceful, reformist approach.
* Herzen noticed a disconnect between the active revolutionaries, whom themselves were often in positions of power and status, and the common populous whom these revolutionaries demanded take up arms. "Better to move forward by peaceful steps than have blood flowing in the gutters" (267).
* Herzen's observations highlight a large gap between the means and ends of revolution: How to strike a balance and gain support between those whom favour reform, verses those whom favour revolution?
* "Like knight-errants in the stories, who have lost their way, we were hesitating at the cross-roads. Go to the right, and you will lose your horse, but you will be safe yourself. Go to the left and your horse will be safe but you will perish; go forward and everyone will abandon you; go back - that was impossible" (267).
#### Bakunin
* Bukunin was a 19th Century Russian revolutionary, adopting the Communist ideologies of Karl Marx. In 1848, was described as an "insurrectionary tourist" for moving from revolution to revolution across Europe. 
* Bukunin was described as roguish, bold, and charismatic, yet na√Øve, and not up to the intellectual rigor of other contemporary revolutionary thinkers.
* Bukunin can be seen as a representation of the fantastical revolutionary leader. One who has the will and recklessness to lead others in a violent overthrow of the government, yet unable to grasp the complex methods of how to do so effectively.
