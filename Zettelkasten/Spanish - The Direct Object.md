# Spanish - The Direct Object



The direct object receives the action of the verb directly.

I see **the tree.**            The direct object can be a thing (the tree).

I see **the woman**.      The direct object can be a person (the woman).

When the direct object is a person, an untranslated **a** is placed before the direct object person. This is called a personal **a**.

Yo veo **a la mujer**.              I see the woman.
Vemos **a Pedro**.                  We see Pedro.

If direct object person is masculine, combine **a** with **el** to form **al** before the direct object person.

Yo visito **al hombre**.            I visit the man.

Personal "a" is used before "agluien" and "nadie".

¿Quieres llamar **a alguien**?                Do you want to call someone?
No puedo llamar **a nadie**.                  I do not want to call anyone.

Personal "a" is not used with "tener".

Tengo dos hermanas.                        I have two sisters.

If direct object is a thing, then no personal "a".

Yo veo el árbol.                   I see the tree.

Transitive Verbs - verbs that take a direct obejct. The direct object will immediately follow the verb in Spanish.

Yo escucho la música.            I **listen to** the music.
Ella mira la casa.                     She **looks at** the house.

The Direct Object Pronoun
---

The direct object pronouns **me, te, nos** all have the same form as their indirect object pronoun counterparts. The only new forms are **lo, los, la, las**.

me - me
te - you
lo - him, it
la - her, it
nos - us
los - them (m.)
las - them (f.)

I see **the man**. - the man is the direct object
I see **him**. - him is the direct object pronoun

I see **the tree**. - the tree is the direct object
I see **it**. - it is the direct object pronoun

The direct object pronoun can be placed in either of two positions in a sentence or phrase.

1. The direct objec pronoun is placed directly before the first verb in a sentence or question.
	1. Ella me conoce bien. - She knows me well.
	2. Los niños te van a escuchar. - The children are going to listen to you.
	3. Ellas nos saludan los lunes. - They greet us on Mondays.
2.  In the second position, the direct object pronoun is *attached to the infinitive* if there is an infinitive in the sentence or question. Whether the direct object pronoun is placed befire the first verb or attached to the infinitive, the meaning is the same.
	1. Ella quiere visitarme en México - She want to visit me in Mexico.
	2. Queremos invitarte a la fiesta. - We want to invite you to the party.
	3. ¿Quién quiere ayudarla? - Who wants to help her?

To express you (Usted) and Ustedes, use the forms le and les respectively.

Yo le conozo, ¿verdad? - I know you, right?
¿Puedo ayudarle? - May I help you?
Les acompañamos al parque - We accompany you to the park.

To make a sentence negative, place a **no** before the direct object pronoun.

No lo veo. - I do not see him.
Ella no me conoce. - She does not know me.
Ella no nos quieren abrazar - They do not want to hug us.

When the direct object pronoun is attached to the infinitive, place **no** before the first verb.

Él no quiere esperame. - He doesn't want to wait for me.
No queremos buscarla. - We don't want to look for her.
