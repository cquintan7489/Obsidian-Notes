Summary
---

The story revolves around Raskolnikov, Rodion Romanovich, a law student living in the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, pawning off the last of his posessions just to get by. He no longer has the funds to continue going to school and is slipping into depression. 

While visiting a bar, we has a conversation with a man named Marmeladov. Marmeladov drunkenly tells Raskolnikov about his current situation: how his family had been on the brink of starvation due to how poor they were. To eleviate the family's dire situation, Marmeladov's oldest daughter solicits herself into prostitution in order to help provide enough money for the rest of the family to survive. In distress, Marmeladov steals the money that his oldest daughter had earned and spends it on a 5 day alcoholic binge. Raskolnikov helps Marmeladov to his home, seeing first hand the impoverished conditions they are in. Raskolnikov gives the family a small amount of money, but later regretting it since he himself has so little money. He especially resents Marmeladov for allowing his family to be in this condition in the first place, to the point that his daughter had to prosititue herself.

Upon returning back to his own apratment, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother. In the letter, Raskolnikov's mother tells him that his sister is to be married to a wealthy man. Although Raskolnikov's mother paints the man in a generous light, Raskolnikov can tell by his mothers words that the man his sister is to marry is exploitative and only wants to marry his sister for the purpose her being obediant to him. His mother says in the letter that because of the marriage, his sister''s new husband will be able to help Raskolnikov out financially. Knowing that his sister would never marry a man like her husband by her own choice, Raskolnikov concludes that she is only marrying this man in order to help him out financially and pay for his schooling. After reading the letter, Raskolnikov becomes furious with himself for allowing his situation to cause his family to make such desparate decisions, comparing himself to the drunk man in the bar who allowed his daughter to prostitue herself in order to provide for the family.

Enraged by the thought of allowing his mother and sister to demean themselves in order to support Raskolnikov, Rodia hastly follows through with a plan to rob and kill the pawn broker that he frequents. Raskolnikov arrives at the pawn brokers apartmemt, tricks her into taking a look at a fake silver cigarette box, and swings an axe into her head, killing her. While hastily robbing the apartmemt of valuables, the pawn broker's niece walks into the apartment, catching Raskolnikov in gruesome act. In order to prevent himself from getting caught, Raskolnikov kills the niece. Completely overwhelmed by the moment, Raskolnikov's escape from the crime scene is delayed by several men coming up the staris to investigate the noise. The men suspect that someone is in the apartment besdies the pawn broker or her niece. While the men momentarily leave to go get the building's caretaker, Raskolnikov leaves the apartment and luckily slips passed all the men by hiding in a side living room at the same moment the men are heading back up the stairs to the apartment.

Miraculously, Raskolnikov slips passed everyone unnoticed. Completely drained and emotionally overwhelmed, Raskolnikov makes his way back to his apartment and passes out on his bed.
