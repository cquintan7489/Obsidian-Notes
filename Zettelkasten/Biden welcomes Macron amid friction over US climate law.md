# Biden welcomes Macron amid friction over US climate law

U.S. president Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron meet in Washington to celebrate long-standing alliance between the two. Initial talks centered around a united effort in the Russian's war in Ukraine and the increasing tensions with China. One key part of Macron's meeting was to levy criticisms to the U.S. recent climate legislation, stating that is it a bad deal for Europe.

The following are criticism brought forward by Macron on U.S. most recent climate legislation.

- U.S. legislation favors American-made climate technology, including electric vehicles. Europe is concerned about the incentives around this legislation.
- Climate actions in Inflation Reduction Act, while a great effort to curb climate crisis, will be a setback for European companies.
- “The choices that have been made ... are choices that will fragment the West,” Macron said. He said the legislation “creates such differences between the United States of America and Europe that all those who work in many companies (in the U.S.), they will just think, ‘We don’t make investments any more on the other side of the Atlantic.’”
- Tax credits to U.S. citizens, encouraging them to buy electric vehicles, would discriminate against European manufacturers, and possibly break World Trade Organization rules.

Marcon plans to seek exceptions to U.S. legislation for some European clean energy manufacturers.

Macron stated that while united on issues concerning Ukraine and geopolitics overall, there are differences on economic issues. 

Macron felt that U.S. legislation on semi-conductor production was not coordintaed with Europe, leaving them out of the playing field.

Comments follow after he had earlier criticized U.S. on putting forth a budget plan for wealthy countries to pay for the damages to poorer countries due to climate changes, but the plan lacked the details to where exactly funds were directed to and why. Further crticisms from Macron include an instance where the U.S. announced a deal to sell submarines to Australia, undercutting a previous deal with France. Biden has since apologised for this "clumsy" decision.

Despite the two nation's difference, both leaders agree that they are strong allies and will continue to be united in the "fight for freedom".
