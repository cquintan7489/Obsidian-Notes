# Spanish - The Indirect Object


The indirect object - receives the action from a verb indirectly. It answers the questions about to whom an action is done. An example would be as follows:

I give the gift to him.

"to him" is the indrect object and "the gift" is the direct object.

In order to have an indirect object in a sentence, a sentence must have a direct object.

Gustar - to be pleasing to

Me is the indirect object referring to "to me". There is no exact translation for "I like".

Spanish: Me gusta este clase.
English: I like this class. (literally "This class is pleasing to me")

**Este clase** is a singular noun - the subject
**Gusta** is the verb and agress with the singular subject
**Me** is the indirect object pronoun - the person to whom the action is occuring.

Me gusta la música.                           The music is pleasing to me
Me gusta el libro                                The book is pleasing to me

In Spanish construction, subjects will keep their articles (el, la, los, las), even when the English translation does not include them.

Ex: Me gusta el chocolate.           I like chocolate

English chocolate, not *the chocolate*. 

If the subject of a sentence is plural, the verb ending will change to agree with the plural subject.

Ex: **Me gustan** los libros                 I like the books.

To make a sentence negative, insert **no** in front of **me gusta** or **me gustan**. 

No me gusta cocinar                      I do not like to cook.

No me gustan las cucarachas         I do not like cockroaches.

Other indirect object pronouns include the following:

te - informal you                             Te gusta comer - You like to eat
le - him/her/formal you                  Le gusta el vino - He likes the wine

** To clarify ambiguity, start sentences with "A él" or "A ella" or "A Usted" **
A ella le gusta el vino                      She likes the wine
** You can also insert proper names or singular nouns instead **
A Fernando le gusta el vino             Fernando likes the wine
Al hombre le gusta cocinar              The man likes to cook

nos - we / to us                                               Nos gusta hablar español - We like to speak spanish
Les - them (ellos / ellas / ustedes)                  Les gusta la película - They like the film
Les pronoun follows the same rules for defining ambiguity as Le pronoun

A ellas les gustan los hoteles                      They like the hotels
A Sara y Enrique les gusta nadar                Sara and Enrique like to swim

The indirect object can be placed in either of two positions in a sentence or phrase.

1. The indirect object is placed *directly before the first verb* in a sentence or question.
	1. Carlos me escribe una carta                       Carlos writes a letter to me
	2. María le escribe una carta a él                   Maria writes a letter to him
	3. Juan le escribe una carta a su primo          Juan writes a letter to his cousin
2.  In the second position, the indirect object is *attached to the infinitive* if there is an infinitive in the sentence or question.
	1. If a sentence only has an infinitive verb, then any indirect object must be attached to the end of the infinitive.
	2.  Antes de prestarte dinero ...                           Before lending you money ...
	3. Después de enseñarnos el francés ...              After teaching us french ...
3. In other cases, sentences may include a phrase with more than one verb, one of which is infinitive. You may also attach an indirect object pronoun to the infinitive in this type of phrase. Both are valid.
	1. Yo quiero escribirte una carta                        I want to write a letter to you
	2. Yo te quiero escribir una carta                       I want to write a letter to you
	3. Pedro quiere darte un libro                            Pedro wants to give you a book
