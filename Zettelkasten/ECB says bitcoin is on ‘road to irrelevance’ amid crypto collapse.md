# ECB says bitcoin is on ‘road to irrelevance’ amid crypto collapse


European Central Bank senior staffers Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf publish a strongly worded blogpost arguing against the legitimacy of Bitcoin.

Criticisms include Bitcoin being a hotbed for illegal transactions, bringing reputaional risks to any institution that get involves in it. Bitcoin's value has recently dropped from a high of $70,000 to a low of $16,000 since the current collapse of FTX crypto exchange. Value is currently stablized at $20,000, but the blogpost counters that the stablization is artifical, through market manipulation. According to the blogpost, large crypto investors have the strongest incentives to keep Bitcoin's legitimacy, and maniulations in cryptocurrency value by individual exchanges or  stablecoin providers are well documented. Since the initial cryptocurrency bubble, lobbying from the crypto sector has proposed to treat cryptocurrency as "just another asset class", despite the risks seen as undisputed by regulators.

“Since bitcoin appears to be neither suitable as a payment system nor as a form of investment, it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimised,” the blogpost concludes.

Bitcoin community pushback includes pointing out that the Euro has declined 20% in value against the U.S. Dollar (In the same period, bitcoin has fallen against the euro by more than 60%).

Bank of England's statement regarding cryptocurrency regulation: “We should not wait until it is large and connected to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary to prevent a crypto shock that could have a much greater destabilising impact.”

The statements by Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf are one of the strongest interventions against cryptocurrency by a leading regulator, stating that "bitcoin is on an “artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance”".
