# Spanish - Reflexive Verbs

A verb is reflexive when the subject and object of a sentence refer to the same person. The action of the verb remains with the subject.

I wash myself.

I (subject) wash (verb) myself (object)

Reflexive pronouns are object pronouns.

me - myself
te - yourself
se - himself, herself, yourself
nos - ourselves
se - themselves, yourselves

In Spanish reflexive verbs, -se is attached to the end of the infinitive. To conjugate the reflexive verb, drop the -se and place the reflexive pronoun before the conjugate verb. The reflexive verb always has a reflexive pronoun.

**lavarse** - to wash oneself

yo me lavo - I wash myself
tú te lavas - you wash yourself
él se lava - he washes himself
nos lavamos - we wash ourselves
ellos se lavan - they wash themselves

Compare the reflexive verb with the nonreflexive verb.

Reflexive: Él se lava. - He washes himself
Non-reflexive: Él lava el carro. - He washes the car.

Reflexive Verbs with Reciprocal Meanings
---

The plural forms of reflexive verbs are sometimes used to express the idea of "each other". If the meaning is unclear, Spanish uses **el uno al otro, la una a la otra, los unos a los otros, las unas a las otras** for clarification. 

ayudarse - to help each other
conocerse - to know each other
entenderse - to understand each other
escribirse - to write to each other
hablarse - to speak to each other
quererse - to love each other
verse - to see each other

Elena y Paula se ayudan mucho. - Elena and Paula help each other a lot.
Mis amigos se ayudan el uno al otro. - My friends help each other.
Nos conocemos bien. - We know each other well.
¿Se conocen Uds.? - Do you know each other?

Roberto y Sonia se quieren. - Robert and Sonia love each other.
Ellos se ven todos los días. - They see each other every day.

Se and Impersonal Expressions
---

In impersonal expressions with **se**, the verb has no personal subject. In English these sentences are translated by the subjects as one, you, they, people (in general), or by the passive voice. The third person singular or plural of the verb is used in these expressions.

How do you say "Hello" in Spanish? - ¿Cómo se dice "hello" en español?

Se vive bien en este país. - One lives well in this country.
Se cree que los italianos son románticos. - It is believed (one believes / people believe) that Italians are romantic.
