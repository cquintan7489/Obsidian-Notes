Value Capture: The process of retaining some percentage of value provided in every transaction.

If you’re able to offer another business something that allows it to bring in $1,000,000 in revenue and you charge $100,000, you’re capturing 10 percent of the value created by the transaction.

Value Capture is a balancing act between Maximizing and Minimizing value capture. You need to capture enough value to make your investment of time and energy worthwhile, but not so much that customers feel as though there is no reason to do business with you.

The more value you capture, the less attractive your offer becomes.


Maximization: Capturing the highest amount of value possible within each transaction. Beneficial in the short turn as maximizing value capture will lead to higher profits. May lead to long term problems, such as eroding customer reason for purchasing. Customers purchase because they perceive they are receiving greater value than what they are giving up. The less they receive, the less they’ll want to buy from you.

Minimization: Capture as little value as possible, while maintaining enough revenue and profit to maintain business operations (sufficiency). While this approach does not capture more value that is available, this approach improves the long-term relationship between customers.
