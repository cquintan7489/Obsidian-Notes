Profit: Bringing in more money than you spend.

It does not matter if your business brings in $100,000,000 in revenue if you spend $100,000,001.

Profit is important because it allows the business to stay in operation. Profit also allows a cushion that allows the business to weather any unexpected changes or events (i.e. sudden expenses and the price of expenses rising).

Profit is important, but not the be-all end-all. Maximizing profits is not that only reason for operating a business, as in the case of creative endeavors. What is important is making enough profits to keep the business successfully operating.
