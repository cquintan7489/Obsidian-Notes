Balance Sheet: A snapshot of what a business owns and what it owes at a particular moment in time. Can also be seen as a estimate of a company’s net worth.

Balance Sheet Calculation: 

**Assets - Liabilities = Owner’s Equity (Net Worth)**

Assets - Things the company owns that has values (products, equipment, stock, etc.)

Liabilities - Obligations that a firm has not yet discharged (loans, financing, etc.)

Balance equation should “balance” if the variables are rearranged

**Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity**

This shows that even if you borrow money, your net worth would not go up or down.

$10,000 loan

$10,000 (Assets) = $10,000(Liabilities) + $0 (Owner’s Equity)

Net worth did not change. Equation will always balance.
