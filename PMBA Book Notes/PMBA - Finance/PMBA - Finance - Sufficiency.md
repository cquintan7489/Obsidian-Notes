Sufficiency: The point where a business is bringing in enough profit that the people who are running the business find it worthwhile to keep going for the foreseeable future.

Business is not necessarily about maximizing profits. Profits are important, but a means to an end. Money is a tool, and the usefulness of that tool depends on what you intended to do with it.

A business reaches a state of sufficiency when revenue covers the operating cost and ownerâ€™s financial needs. This point is subjective from person to person.
