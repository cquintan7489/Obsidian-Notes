Cash Flow Statement: A financial statement that is an examination of the incoming and outbound cash of a companies bank account over the course of a specified period of time.

Cash flow statement is one of the most straightforward financial reports to track how well a company is performing. 

Ideally more money flows in than flows out, and the total amount of cash at a given time never goes below zero.

Cash tends to move in three primary areas:

- Operations (selling offers and buying inputs)
- Investing (collecting dividends and paying for capital expenses)
- Financing (Borrowing money and paying it back)

As a general rule, the more cash your business has at its disposal, the more options it has and the more resilient the business becomes.
