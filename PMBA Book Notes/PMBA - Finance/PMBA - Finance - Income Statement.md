Income Statement: A financial statement containing an estimate of the business’s profit over a certain period of time, once revenue is matched with the related expenses.

General format of an Income Statement:

**Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Expenses - Taxes = Net Profit

For some business, a cash flow statement is not enough to provide an accurate picture of a business’s financial status. A business can bring in a lot of cash for a certain period of time, but can still be losing money in the long term.

Income statements (sometimes called profit and loss statements) are created by matching each sale with its corresponding revenue generated and expenses incurred, calculating the profit for each individual sale made.

In order to produce an accurate Income Statement, large expenses are often spread out as smaller expenses across each sale over a certain period of time. This is a process known as Amortization. This is to prevent misleading Income Statements, where a large expense will make it appear that a business is losing money one period, but totally normal the next period.
