Valuation: The estimate of the total worth of a company.

The higher a businessâ€™s revenue, the stronger its profit margins, the higher its bank balance, and the more promising its future, the higher its Valuation.

A company with a higher Valuation can borrow money easier, command higher prices for shares, and lead to a bigger payday if acquired by another company.
