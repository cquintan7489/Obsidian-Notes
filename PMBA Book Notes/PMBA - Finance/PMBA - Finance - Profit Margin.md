Profit Margin (often abbreviated to “margin”) is the difference between how much revenue to capture and how much you spend to capture it, expressed in percentage terms.

Formula for Profit Margin:  ((Revenue - Cost) / Revenue) x 100 = % Profit Margin

If you are able to create a product for $100 and sell it for $150, then the profit is $50 and the profit margin is 33%. If you sell that same product for $300, then the profit margin is 66%. 

The higher the sales price and lower the cost, the higher the Profit Margin.

Profit Margin can never exceed 100%.

Most businesses try to keep Profit Margins as high as possible. The higher the margin, the more money the business gets to keep.

Businesses often use Profit Margins as a way of comparing offers. As business tend to favor their offers with high margins, if costs need to be cut, then it often starts with eliminating the offers with the lowest margins.

Higher the margin, stronger the business.
